# Introduction


##  A little big story

It is not common to start the documentation of using a
software by a little story.

But ChordV is for people who love the song and in
all the songs there is a story.

I will tell you why I created ChordV.

I realized that my friends guitarists and singers had nostalgia
notebooks that featured on the same page lyrics and chords.
This is the classic mode that suits all fans.

On the other hand, if I have known many songs that I would have liked to gather in
this type of booklets, it turns out that a little over ten years ago I am
produced on small Parisian scenes with my own songs. I have little to
little asked to sing here and there in France and everywhere my little ones
catchphrases. I met quite quickly musicians who asked me
no longer singing books, but chord boxes.

Thirdly, it turns out that when I sing in front of friends, they
I care about the lyrics so I can sing with me. These friends are neither
amateur guitarists or professional guitarists and they do not read
colorful guitar pattern texts.

Finally to finish, I record my discs with Ardor under Linux machine.
I record, I listen to the result, I re-record and sometimes several times.

During the recording days I try several interpretations and at the end
two or three times I do not know if I sang a verse or if it was
in the previous song that I had sung. So I hesitate and that means
on the recordings. So I needed a memory aid mode.

Once I developed the memory aid I recorded, but once I
resumed the recording I had to do a lot of manipulations with the mouse.

That's how I thought of linking Ardor to ChordV so that the lyrics would come back in the beginning
when I ask the recorder to go back to the beginning.

I miss one last point to be complete, I like Open Source, it's my job,
I like to develop. My songs are all open sources in Creative Common, they are delivered
in demonstration of Chord V.

Finally, I could not develop software that does not run on Linux and that is not open source.

I developed ChordV in C ++ with the Qt5 library. It is portable MacOsx, Windows or tablet
Android or Apple, but I do not have time to make the installer for these environments.

It's getting late, I have concerts to honor, they bring me a lot of happiness. I also have
an activity of computer scientist and teacher to continue. I have a family that sees me too often
back writing programs or songs.

It's getting late, I have to let you discover Chord V.

## Chord V presentation


- ChordV allows you to produce different types of PDF files for
list of songs
- ChordV provides:
    - a text editor with syntactic colorization and insertion of
    Tags in cho format
    - an chords manager and a guitar chord basis
    To add or insert chords
    - four processors to generate a book containing the
    Lyrics without the chords, a book with
	Chords and lyrics, a book with chord grids and a lyric monitoring
	solution.
- For each of the modes, the options management makes it possible to
Appropriate settings
   - **Text:** in this mode, the lyrics alone appear, without
   No chord representation
   - **Lyrics:** In this mode, text and chords are displayed.
   - **Chords:** in this mode, chords are not displayed. It is
   Useful for accompanying musicians.
   - **Memory:** in this mode, only the beginning of the text are displayed

- ChordV uses a very efficient and simple tag language Chord Pro:
   
   
~~~
{title:Let it be}

{subtitle: Lyrics ansd music :  Paul McCartney, John Lennon}
{Subtitle: Apple Label}
{columns:1 }
When I  [C] find myself in  [G]  times of trouble
Am Mother  [G] Mary  [F]  comes to me
[C] Speaking words of  [G] wisdom, let it  [F | C/E] be.       [Dm7][C]
And  [C] in my hour of  [G]  darkness
She is  [Am] standing  [G] right in   [F]  front of me
[C] Speaking words of  [G] wisdom, let it  [F | C/E] be.       [Dm7][C]
~~~~

Chord V can use the chord pro file as is, but
by losing the benefit of the rhythmic tracking of the lyrics of the memorization mode.

In ChordV we will tend to indicate whether the chord apply to a measurement
or a rhythm as well:

~~~
{title:Let it be}

{subtitle: Lyrics ansd music :  Paul McCartney, John Lennon}
{Subtitle: Apple Label}
{columns:1 }
When I  [C:2] find myself in  [G:2]  times of trouble
Am Mother  [G:2] Mary  [F:2]  comes to me
~~~~

The notation [C: 2] indicates that the chord of Do is played on half a measure.
See chapter [Time Signature and Tempo](#TimeSignature) for
the details of the times on the chords.


# The edit window

## Presentation

### The Edit Window

![The editing window](./img/editor.png)

1. The edit menu allows you to access the replace functions
and zoom the font. Next to the menu items
keyboard shortcuts.
2. The icons are used to insert the Hedging Notes, the
and all the information that is highlighted in purple in the figure.
3. The text box allows you to enter the songs in
chord pro
4. The log section displays error messages labeled in red
and success messages labeled green.
5. When you select a chord, by pressing the
Mouse up or down you go up or down the duration of a
chord. Thus we pass from [Do#x2] to [Do#] and then to [Do:2] by turning
the wheel to yourself.
6. A table of content browser to go directly on choosen title


### The list of songs 


![List of songs](./img/toc.png)

The list of songs is automatically built, in other words
when you enter a tag '{title: Accroche}' this list is
automatically generated.

By clicking on one of the song titles, you will be directed to the
title of the song in the text.

Two things are noteworthy:

- if you enter the memory help mode via the F8 key you
find this list but we will return to its use (attention
to return to editor mode you will have to go back to editor mode
by the F2 key).
- Note that if you clicked on a title, that title is automatically
selected in the help window.
- The second thing to notice is that the title of the song appears
in the status area at the bottom of the screen. We will come back to it.

## The status bar 

![Status bar](./img/statusbar.png)

1. The window in which you are can be the text editor, the global definitions, the text mode settings,
the chord mode settings, the chord mode and text settings, and the word monitoring world management
2. The name of the file which appears in green if the file can be modified and in red otherwise
3. The name of the directory which appears in green if the directory can be accessible in writing modified and in red in the opposite case
4. The number of songs contained in the current file
5. The name of the selected song or the song whose selection is retained.
6. A blocking mode to keep the selected song saved, which can be useful if you are working in the lyrics monitoring mode
especially in the case of a recording session where the song will be recorded several times.

# Le menu général 

## Présentation 

![The menu](./img/menu.png)

The general menu allows you to manage
    - the File menu
    - the Editing submenu
    - the Window submenu
    - the Tools submenu
    - the Help submenu


## The File submenu

By starting to manipulate the different menu items, which are
at least very classical, we can notice that we can open
cho3 files or project files.

Cho3 files are classic chord files, with tags
extended chordV.

Chop files are project files containing
    - an cho3 file included in the file and not a linked file.
    This means that you can copy only the chop file that
    is completely autonomous.
    - Ini format attributes that allow you to save everything
    what you are interested in the layout: color of
    cover, front and back, margins etc ...
    
Currently the standard cho evolves to allow the addition of these
attributes but on the one hand the files quickly become unreadable
the opportunities offered are much more limited than those offered
that offers you chordV.

It is therefore advisable to work with chop files and if you
must give someone who uses chordpro ​​a file that he can
read, just export the file.

Similarly if you find a chorpro file you can import it by
the file menu.

Finally note that at the end of the list of items you can recover
the list of the last 10 open chop files.


## The Edition sub menu

## The View sub menu 

## The tools sub menu 

## The help sub menu



# ChordV tags

## The chord pro tag language

It may be strange that modern software does not
WysiWyg interface, that looks like the output
paper. Actually ChordV takes only one input format and is capable of
to generate a text booklet, a booklet of text and chords, a booklet
with chords grids and memory aid. In what mode
He choose to work? We chose the tag mode that
a pivot format.

In addition this pivot format is written in the chord pro language of the
extensions useful to the program. So you can load in ChordV
all chord pro files available in the resources
music of the net.



## The titles

### Document title

~~~ chord

~~~
{title: title of the song}
~~~


It's the title of a song. There are as many title headings as songs
in the document. You can only have one title per song. If we define two
consecutive titles one provokes a page break with an empty song for the first.


The abbreviated notation is {t: title}

### Subtitle of a song

~~~
{subtitle: subtitle of a song}
~~~

It's a subtitle, accompanying the song. Several subtitles can be provided
which will be separated by line breaks.

The names of authors, composers or performers can be found in this
category.

The abbreviated notation is {st: title}

## Rhythmic signature and tempo {#SignatureRytmique}

### Notes

These values ​​will be reported in the chord grid mode and widely used in the memory aid mode.

### Tempo

- The tempo will be represented by the beacon

~~~
{Tempo: 12O}
{Tempo: 112.5}
~~~

If the tempo is omitted, the value 120 will be assigned.

The tempo is the number of times per minute. It can include one or more decimals, the decimal separator is the point
whatever the language chosen.

The introduction of a decimal is unusual in conventional musical notation, but some software allows
this extension for example when they deduce the value of the tempo of a piece

### Rhythmic signature

- The rhythmic signature of a song is represented by the tag {time: 4/4}

- If no rhythmic signature is mentioned for a song, the value 4/4 will be assigned


## Chord


### Basic notation


- In English format (if the format is configured in English) we follow the notation ABCDEFG

~~~
[A]
~~~

- In French format (if configured as such), we follow the notation La Si Do Ré Mi Fa Sol

~~~
[La]
~~~

- The minor mode is noted - if the chords are in English and m if they are in French and configured as such
- The mode 7 6 5 13 etc are noted in numbers

### Extended notation

- The bars are noted in Roman numerals with the box of the bar:


~~~
[A(V)]
~~~


- Extention of time


These extensions were introduced by chord V and are being discussed with the authors of the ChordPro format definition


x number indicates the number of measurements of the chord

~~~
[A(V)x3]
~~~

By default an chord without added measure will be considered as an chord of a measure

So [A] will be an chord of a measure

- division of time

: indicates a division of the measure {#TimeSignature}

So for a 4/4 signature measure the ratings:

- [A:2] will mean a measure divided by 2 ie 2 beats
- [A:4] will mean a measure divided by 4 ie 1 time


### Inserting chords into the editor

By double clicking on the text the chord include window you
to select a chord by pressing the Insert button
the chord. This action can also be taken by the support of
the F4 key (while the F3 key is used to enter the
management chord)

You can change the tempo by using the mouse wheel
holding down the SHIFT key in the editor.

## Compatibility Chordpro

### Introduction

Chord V is designed to produce 4 types of documents at the same time
and some chord pro tags are designed for a single use. So we
do not want to output the same format for each of the
documents, knowing that the booklets of words are perhaps intended
to a printed file and the tuning grid files may be
be for PDF files for a reader or tablet.

Chord reads Chordpro ​​files and knows how to extract
ChordPro compatible file.

Some tags are not used because replaced by the graphical interface.
