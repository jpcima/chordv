## Compatibility Chordpro

### Introduction

Chord V is designed to produce 4 types of documents at the same time
and some chord pro tags are designed for a single use. So we
do not want to output the same format for each of the
documents, knowing that the booklets of words are perhaps intended
to a printed file and the tuning grid files may be
be for PDF files for a reader or tablet.

Chord reads Chordpro ​​files and knows how to extract
ChordPro compatible file.

Some tags are not used because replaced by the graphical interface.
